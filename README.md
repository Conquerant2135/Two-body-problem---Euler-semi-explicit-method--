# Two body problem
This is a simple simulation of a stellar object revolving around another by using the Euler semi-explicit method ( symplectic Euler ) 

# Formulae 
We need to use the Newton laws of gravitation 
In the scalar form :

```math
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
```

And the vectorial form :

```math
\vec{F}_{1,2} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{\|\vec{r}_{1,2}\|^3} \vec{r}_{1,2}
```
